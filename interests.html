                <h2>Forensic Science</h2>
                <p>As a kid, I would spent a lot of time with my Godmother because my mother often had to work. During the time I spent in her home, she would always have true crime shows playing on the television. Instead of princess stories, I heard stories of people murdering their spouses for money, siblings making eloborate plans the avenge eachother in the worst way possible, and delusional parants taking the lives of their own children. Ever since then I have been completely addicted to forensic science and crime. It had always facinated me how just one drop of blood form a defensive wound could be a killers worst mistake. Even the way a person kills and disposes of the body can lead to exactly who they are. This interet is actually the insporation for my career choice of a Fornsic Scientist. Although I know its not going to be as fun as in looks on the television shows, I'm still very excited.</p>
