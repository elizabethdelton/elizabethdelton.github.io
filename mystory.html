            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>I honestly thank God for this life he has given me. Although not everything was not perfect, I was raised in a nice home with loving parents and two annoying, but loving, older brothers. I also thank God for my struggles because, at the end of the day, what is life without struggle? And although I have not tackled every issue in my life, I could not have made this far without the amazing support of my family an my fellow church members. I hope that sharing my struggles as well as the progress I have made will be helpfull to those deal wth the same thing.
            <
            What exactly is my struggle though?<br><br>
            Well, Insecurity.</p>
